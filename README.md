# TensorFlow-MNIST-machine-learning
This program implements the MNIST computer vision data set tutorial from TensorFlow in order to begin teaching myself 
the concepts of machine learning. It basically uses a soft-max (multinomial logistic) regression to train a model to 
recognize hand-written numbers and determine the corresponding number by looking at every pixel in the image.
